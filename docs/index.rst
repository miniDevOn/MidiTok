**MidiTok** is a Python package for MIDI file tokenization, presented at the ISMIR 2021 LBDs `(paper) <https://archives.ismir.net/ismir2021/latebreaking/000005.pdf>`_.
It converts MIDI files to sequences of tokens ready to be fed to sequential Deep Learning models such as Transformers.

MidiTok features most known MIDI :ref:`tokenizations`, and is built around the idea that they all share common methods. It properly pre-process MIDI files, and supports :ref:`Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)`.
`Github repository <https://github.com/Natooz/MidiTok>`_

Installation
==================

..  code-block:: bash

    pip install miditok

MidiTok uses `MIDIToolkit <https://github.com/YatingMusic/miditoolkit>`_ and `Mido <https://github.com/mido/mido>`_ to read and write MIDI files, and BPE is backed by `Hugging Face ü§ótokenizers <https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers>`_ for super fast encoding.

Citation
==================

If you use MidiTok for your research, a citation in your manuscript would be gladly appreciated. ‚ù§Ô∏è

You can also find BibTeX :ref:`citations` of tokenizations.
